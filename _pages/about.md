Welcome to my personal website! I am a PhD student working at the [LIVIA](https://liviamtl.ca/) lab ETS under the supervision of Prof. [Marco Pedersoli](https://www.etsmtl.ca/en/research/professors/mpedersoli/) and [Eric Granger](https://www.etsmtl.ca/en/research/professors/egranger). My research is focussed on learning object detectors with reduced amount of supervision. Particularly, we are exploring weakly supervised, and semi-supervised methods to train detectors with less annotation. At the application side, we are focussing on object detection in aerial images from drones and satellites.
