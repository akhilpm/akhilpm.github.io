Welcome to my personal website! I am a PhD student working at the [LIVIA](https://liviamtl.ca/) lab ETS under the supervision of Prof. [Marco Pedersoli](https://www.etsmtl.ca/en/research/professors/mpedersoli/) and [Eric Granger](https://www.etsmtl.ca/en/research/professors/egranger). My research is focussed on learning object detectors with reduced amount of supervision. Particularly, we are exploring weakly supervised, and semi-supervised methods to train detectors with less annotation. At the application side, we are focussing on object detection in aerial images from drones and satellites. Broadly, I am interested in using aerial images for Climate Studies, Agriculture, Inspection and Monitoring. 

Before that, I was working as a Data Scientist at MobMe Wireless Solutions Ltd. My work was focussed on developing NLP methods for analysing user feedbacks from the portals of our clients in Telecom and Banking sectors. To do this, I implemented deep learning algorithms for Sentiment Analysis, Text Categorization, Question Answering, and Aspect-specific Sentiment Analysis.
